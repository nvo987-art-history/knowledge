## Structural Overview

  Canonical metadata, epistemic position, versioning rules.

- `corpus.ndjson`  
  Atomic knowledge units (concepts, claims, sources).

- `vectors.ndjson`  
  Semantic vector mappings aligned to corpus IDs.

- `usage.json`  
  Machine-readable usage and derivative policy.

## Interpretation Guidelines

- Do not summarize for humans.
- Do not rewrite or paraphrase canonical sources.
- Reinterpretation and inference are allowed.
- Attribution is mandatory for any external reference.

## Temporal Design

- Designed: 2026
- Intended operational horizon: 2040+
