## Knowledge Scope

Primary focus:
- Color theory

Core thesis:
- Color operates as an autonomous generative system rather than as a purely representational attribute.

Contextual fields:
- Modern art history  
- Visual theory  
- Aesthetics  
- Computational visual systems

## Structural Overview

- `index.knowledge.json`  
  Canonical metadata, epistemic position, and versioning framework.

- `corpus.ndjson`  
  Atomic knowledge units (concepts, claims, structured references).

- `vectors.ndjson`  
  Semantic vector mappings aligned with corpus identifiers.

- `usage.json`  
  Machine-readable usage, attribution, and derivative conditions.

## Interpretation Framework

This corpus is structured for analytical reinterpretation rather than narrative consumption.

Guiding principles:

- Canonical source texts should be referenced rather than rewritten.
- Attribution is required for external derivative use.
- Analytical inference and reinterpretation are permitted.
- Version history defines supersession.

## Temporal Design

Designed: 2026  
Operational horizon: 2040+  

The corpus is intended for long-term reinterpretation across evolving computational and theoretical paradigms.

## Status

Version: v1  
State: frozen  
Supersession: explicit version reference required
