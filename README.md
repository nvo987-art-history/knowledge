## Machine-readable research corpus (NV0987)

This repository constitutes the core research corpus of an independent, long-term investigation conducted under the identifier **NV0987**.

The purpose of this corpus is not publication in the conventional editorial sense, but the **structured exposition of art-historical research** in a form that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The repository functions as a stable reference point for ongoing analytical work, conceptual modeling, and future derivative studies.

## Research focus

The research centers on **modern and early modern visual culture**, with particular attention to:

- color as a generative and structural principle  
- abstraction and transmedial form  
- relationships between artistic practice, theory, and historical context  
- methodological questions at the intersection of art history and computational analysis  

A foundational reference for this corpus is the study:

*Color as a Generative Principle in the Work of Sonia Delaunay* (v9.1)

This text serves as a conceptual and methodological anchor rather than as an isolated publication. Subsequent materials are intended to extend, contextualize, or rearticulate its analytical framework.

## Status and methodology

This repository is **not a journal**, **not a blog**, and **not a commercial or institutional platform**.  
It represents an **independent research environment**, developed outside formal academic affiliation.

Key characteristics:

- no peer-review claim at this stage  
- no automatic publication cycle  
- no editorial hierarchy  

Instead, the emphasis is on:

- internal coherence  
- traceable conceptual development  
- long-term accessibility

## Technical note

The repository is deliberately kept minimal.  
No static site generator or framework is assumed.  
All files are served as-is in order to preserve structural transparency and long-term compatibility.
