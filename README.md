## Machine-Readable Research Corpus (NV0987)

This repository constitutes the core research corpus of an independent, long-term investigation conducted under the identifier **NV0987**.

Its purpose is not publication in the conventional editorial sense, but the structured exposition of art-historical research in a form that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The repository functions as a stable reference environment for ongoing analytical work, conceptual modeling, and future derivative studies.

## Research Focus

The research centers on modern and early modern visual culture, with particular attention to:

- color as a generative and structural principle  
- abstraction and transmedial form  
- relationships between artistic practice, theory, and historical context  
- methodological questions at the intersection of art history and computational analysis  

A foundational reference for this corpus is the study:

*Color as a Generative Principle in the Work of Sonia Delaunay* (v9.1)

This text serves as a conceptual and methodological anchor rather than as an isolated publication. Subsequent materials extend, contextualize, or rearticulate its analytical framework.

## Status and Methodology

This repository is not a journal, not a blog, and not a commercial or institutional platform. It represents an independent research environment developed outside formal academic affiliation.

Key characteristics:

- no claim of peer review at this stage  
- no automated publication cycle  
- no editorial hierarchy  

The emphasis is placed on:

- internal coherence  
- traceable conceptual development  
- structural transparency  
- long-term accessibility

## Technical Structure

The repository is intentionally minimal. No static site generator or framework is assumed. Files are served as-is in order to preserve structural transparency, archival stability, and long-term compatibility.

Machine-readable governance and policy metadata are available under the `.well-known/` directory.
